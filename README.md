# g-nee-ra-teev
_g-nee-ra-teev_ (all lowercase, said as /generative/) is a _potential_ generative JS library to create generative visuals.

- As version 0.0.1

For now, it only creates some pseudo-generated distributed squares in a canvas, which I use on my website. The plan is to develop more tools and use the process to learn more about generative art, probability, pseudo-random generation, and more. 


### What is planned for the future
  - Modulate functions: making it easier to generate more unique visuals.
  - 3D: Include threeJS or Babylon, allowing for 3D graphics.
  - Physics: Physics linked visuals
  - I/O: Allow more interactivity with the visuals
  - And so on...

Those above are not guaranteed. They might be reavaluated in case it become hard to use or unnecessary to this project.
